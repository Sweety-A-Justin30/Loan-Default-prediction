# Loan Default Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to predict **loan defaults** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer demographics, account balances, and transaction behaviors, the model helps financial institutions mitigate risks and make data-driven lending decisions.

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Performed feature selection and encoding
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed loan default trends and key risk factors
   - Visualized correlations between features
3. **Model Building**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC
4. **Deployment**
   - Finalized the best-performing model for real-time predictions

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Contains customer details, loan amounts, transaction history, and loan status.
- **Target Variable:** Loan Default (1: Default, 0: No Default)
